### 1. What is the difference between var, let, and const? 

1. var is an old keyword in JavaScript for declaring variables, which are limited to function scope. It allows declared variables to be redeclared and updated repeatedly.

2. let is a keyword used in modern JavaScript, which is limited to block scope. Variables declared with it cannot be redeclared, but their values ​​can be changed.

3. const is a keyword used in JavaScript to declare a constant value, which is limited to the block scope. The variable declared through it cannot be redeclared or the value changed, but the elements inside the object or array can be changed.

### 2. What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?

1. map function is an array method in JavaScript that applies a specific function to each element of the original array and returns a new array. The new array contains the changed values, but the original array remains unchanged.

2. forEach function is an array method in JavaScript that applies a specific function to each element of the original array, but does not return a new array. It is used to work only with each element.

3. filter function is an array method in JavaScript that tests each element of the original array against a condition and returns a new array containing those that meet the condition. The original array remains unchanged.

### 3. What are arrow functions in ES6?

Arrow Function is a new way of writing functions in ES6, which makes the code shorter and simpler. It is written using the => symbol.

### 4. How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?

Destructuring Assignment is a modern feature of ES6, which is a way to directly assign values ​​from an array or object to a separate variable. This allows us to make our code shorter, cleaner, and easier to read.

### 5. Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?

Template literals are a new way of writing strings in ES6, written using backticks. Through them, we can easily write variables, expressions, and multiline strings.
